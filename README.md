This repository used to host the source code of the program that controls the "Libro Tecnologico" which is part of the project 'Arazzo Teconologico' of the Istituto Tullio Buzzi of Prato <http://www.itistulliobuzzi.it/>
More info about the project: <http://www.itistulliobuzzi.it/buzziwebsite/docenti/arazzo/ARAZZO%20TECNOLOGICO.pdf>

I removed this repository on 2020-01-01 because:

1. It was written in python2.7 which reached its end-of-life on 2020-01-01.
2. It was programmed by me and other students when we were in high scool, resulting in a messy code with italian variable names, not well organized and not well documented. Definetly not production code. 
3. Some changes in the wx.media APIs broke the compability years ago thus it is not possible to run the program right now.
4. I just don't want to mantain this project now after six years.

I have a copy of the source code, if you want it write to me: luciotuttominuscolo@inventati.org
